<h4>Welcome</h4>

    <p>
        My name is <b>Mikhail Korniichenko</b>. Currently I am a <b>Game Developer.</b> 
        I am primarly focused on developing games using Unreal Engine, but I also have experience working with low-level things. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In a spare time, I'm learning new things. Currently I'm interested in desktop and web development, particulary using Microsoft's .NET Core.<br>
        You can check out my spare time projects on my <a href="https://github.com/Sajoniks" class="">GitHub</a>.
