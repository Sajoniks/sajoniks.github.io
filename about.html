<h4>About me</h4>
<p>Making games is my passion. Since childhood, I was always interested how games work under the hood, and the actual process of game development.</p>

<p>
    Until 2020, I have been developing games as an indie developer. Many of them were scrapped. 
    I also tried to develop games from scratch, for example, I have <a href="https://github.com/Sajoniks/SolitaireCPP" class="link-warning">Solitaire game</a> that I made using C++ and only SFML library.
</p>
<p>At the age of 15, I had published my first game at GameJolt platform.</p>
<p>
    Being inspired from its popularity, I decided to delve into game development. 
    By now, I have worked at least 3 large team projects, several of them released, some of them are still under development. 
    My main usually is to develop complex core systems, sometimes gameplay mechanics.
</p>
<p>
    On my spare time, I work on my own projects. For example, I have a game under development. Details about these things I post on my <a href="/projects" class="link-warning">Projects</a> page.

                This is one of my first games made with Unreal Engine that was not scrapped :)
                This is a chess game. It has Hot Seat and LAN play modes.
                All assets (excluding music) were made by me.
