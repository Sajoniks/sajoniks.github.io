# Welcome

Welcome to my website.

My name is Mikhail, and I am a game developer. I am primarly focused on developing games using Unreal Engine 4, but I also have experience working with low-level things.


Developing games is my passion. Since childhood, I was always interested how games work under the hood, and the actual process of game development.


Until 2020, I did games as an indie developer, but many of them were scrapped. I also tried to develop games from scratch, for example, I have [Solitaire](https://github.com/Sajoniks/SolitaireCPP) game that I made using C++ and only SFML library. 

At the age of 15, I had my first game published. You can see it on a [GameJolt page](https://gamejolt.com/games/five-nights-at-heavy-s/56590).

Being inspired from its popularity, I decided to delve into game development. By now, I have worked at least 3 large team projects, several of them released, some of them are still under development. My main usually was to develop complex core systems rather that gameplay mechanics, and I love it. 

Currenly I am working on a MMORPG PIONER. You can see info on [its main page](https://pionergame.com/).

On my spare time, I work on my own projects. For example, I have a game under development. I can't tell any details because game is still in early prototype :) 

Most of other projects are gameplay frameworks for Unreal Engine 4, that are being developed as a part of my game.
